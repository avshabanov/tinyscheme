## Overview

This repo is merely a mirror of tinyscheme project from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyscheme

I am not an original author and this copy exists only for the sake of having tinyscheme on github and personal experimentation (on dev branches).

master branch will always contain unchanged tinyscheme sources.
